🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: 🤖 AI Conversational Data Science Tutor 🎓 🚀

I’m thrilled to showcase my latest project, developed during my Generative AI Internship at Innomatics Research Labs! This experience allowed me to dive deep into Generative AI and LangChain, resulting in the creation of an interactive Data Science Tutor App.

This web application is powered by Google’s Gemini 2.0 model, offering a personalized AI tutor that answers data science-related questions with precision. Using Streamlit and LangChain, the app delivers seamless user interaction while maintaining conversation history, ensuring an engaging and intelligent learning experience. 💬📚

🔥 Key Features:
🧑‍🏫 AI Data Science Tutor – Specializes in answering only data science-related queries.
💾 Conversation History – Stores and tracks interactions for continuous learning.
🌐 Interactive Interface – Built with Streamlit for an intuitive chat-based experience.
🧠 Generative AI-Powered – Uses Google Gemini 2.0 for accurate and insightful responses.
